# Fonts
These are the fonts that I am using (or have used) for this setup.

My current Nerd Font of choice is [Agave](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#agave) right now. I'm sure that'll change in the future. I've uploaded a copy here just for fun.

I like to cycle through the different options available in the [Ultimate Old School PC Font Pack](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/). The Toshiba Satellite ones are so good. I have only uploaded my personal choices, so if you want to see the rest, use the link to their site. ðŸ¥²
