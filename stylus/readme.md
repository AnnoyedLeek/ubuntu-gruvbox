# Stylus
Stylus custom-injects CSS into webpages. It's pretty simple and elegent, and I haven't found an alternative that I prefer. Take back the web and customize the corporate part for yourself and all that... yada yada.

The Stylus extension can be downloaded in the places listed below. Personally, I only use it in Firefox because I'm trying to remove myself from Google's soul-sucking environment as much as I can.

[Firefox - Mozilla Extension Storefront](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)

[Chrome Extension Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)

Thank you to Xedecimal for the Stylus userstyles. I am uploading a copy of each .css file to this repository for redundancy, but will link the original repo below:
