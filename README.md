# ubuntu-gruvbox
My personal gruvbox setup on Ubuntu 22.04 using assets from around the world wide web (tm):

I will write instructions later someday, but for now the repos that I used are all linked in their respective directory's readme.

## Mozilla Customization
I use a couple different plugins for Mozilla software.

For Firefox I use [this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gruvbox-dark-theme/) plugin by [Calvin](https://gitlab.com/calvinchd) over on GitLab.

For Thunderbird, I use [this](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/user/calvinchd/) plugin, which is also from Calvin. Copy the link inside the client under the "Add-Ons" menu and it should pop right up.
